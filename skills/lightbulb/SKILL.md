# Lightbulb

End-to-end autonomous development from a GitHub issue. Dispatches subagents for each phase: planning, implementation, review, and fix. All work happens in an isolated git worktree. The orchestrator (you) manages phase transitions, relays user interaction, and handles the PR lifecycle.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the lightbulb skill to develop issue #N end-to-end."

## Input

- `issue_number` (required) — GitHub issue number in the current repo.
- `max_review_rounds` (optional, default 5) — cap on review-fix loop iterations.

Parse these from the user's message. If the issue number is ambiguous, ask.

## Flow

```
1. Parse input (issue number, optional max rounds)
2. Fetch issue from GitHub
3. Set up worktree — REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: superpowers:using-git-worktrees
4. PLAN — dispatch planning subagent
5. IMPLEMENT — dispatch implementation subagent
6. Create draft PR linked to the issue
7. REVIEW LOOP (up to N rounds)
8. Check CI pipelines
9. Ask user: mark PR ready (default) or merge
```

## Step 1: Fetch Issue

Use `gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels` or the GitHub MCP tool to fetch the issue. Store the title and body — you'll pass these to subagents.

If the issue doesn't exist or is closed, tell the user and stop.

## Step 2: Set Up Worktree

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` to create an isolated workspace.

The worktree branch name should be derived from the issue: `feature/issue-<number>-<slug>` where `<slug>` is a short kebab-case summary of the issue title.

## Step 3: PLAN Phase

Dispatch a planning subagent (Agent tool, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) with this prompt structure:

> You are a planning agent. Your job is to design and plan the implementation for a GitHub issue.
>
> **Issue #N: {ISSUE_TITLE}**
>
> {ISSUE_BODY}
>
> Use `superpowers:brainstorming` to explore the codebase, understand the problem, and design a solution. When brainstorming needs user input (clarifying questions, design choices), return them to me — I will relay to the user and resume you with answers.
>
> After brainstorming is complete, use `superpowers:writing-plans` to write a detailed implementation plan to `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.
>
> Do NOT proceed to implementation. Do NOT invoke finishing-a-development-branch. Your job ends when the plan file is written.
>
> When you need user input, return a message starting with `USER_INPUT_NEEDED:` followed by the question.
>
> When the plan is complete, return a message starting with `PLAN_COMPLETE:` followed by the plan file path.

**Relay pattern:** When the planning subagent returns `USER_INPUT_NEEDED:`, use `AskUserQuestion` to relay the question to the user, then resume the subagent (Agent tool with `resume` parameter) with the user's answer.

**When PLAN_COMPLETE:** Read the plan file, commit it, and proceed to Step 4.

```
git add docs/*.md
git commit -m "docs: add implementation plan for issue #N"
```

## Step 4: IMPLEMENT Phase

Read the plan file to get the full plan text.

Dispatch an implementation subagent (Agent tool, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) with this prompt structure:

> You are an implementation agent. Implement the following plan using `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`.
>
> **Plan:**
>
> {FULL_PLAN_TEXT}
>
> Follow the plan task by task. SDD will handle per-task reviews (spec + quality).
>
> **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT invoke `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` when done. The orchestrator handles the PR lifecycle. When all tasks are complete, just report back.
>
> When you need clarification, return a message starting with `USER_INPUT_NEEDED:` followed by the question.
>
> When implementation is complete, return a message starting with `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE:` followed by a summary of what was implemented.

**Relay pattern:** Same as planning — relay `USER_INPUT_NEEDED:` to the user, resume with answers.

**When IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE:** Proceed to Step 5.
